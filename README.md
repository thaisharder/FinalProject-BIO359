# FinalProject-BIO359
The data used on this paper was collected by Dr. Matthew Ramsey at University of Rhode Island and by his graduate students Eric Almeida and Dasith Perera. To write this project, I received an execel sheet named "genes" (available on my github repository). As part of this assignment I organized the table, and performed different analyses on RStudio using approches that I learned during this course (BIO539). 

This repository contains:
A script (script1sh) that was used to analyze the raw RNAseq data using HTSeq and bowtie. This code was wrote in Dr. Ramsey lab

A table generated after runing the script above (genes.cvs)

A table (genes_filter.csv) that was filtered for significant values only (p<0.05)

The R script (scrip_final.Rmd) with all codes that were used to write the paper. It includes codes to analyze the data and generate graphs and tables.

A paper (final_project.pdf) generated in Rmarkdown.
